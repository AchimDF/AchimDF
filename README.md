# 5th Year NeuroScience 

## Why did I enroll in this course ?
Ive heard a lot of postive things about you as a profressor from previous students and academic advisor Erin Sparks.
I also took my first cmputer programing course last year which got me interested to learn more about programing.
I wanted to see how Neuroscience and data science work together.

## what got me Interested in Neuroscice?
The brain was something that was never realy emphasized in my science classes in high school and I was really interested in the brain anatomy portion. 
As I progress throught this degree, I've come to realize the many other aspects of Neuroscience that are connected to it and my interets in those as well.

## what are my career/Future PLans?
I would like to persue a career in medicine and attended a medical school here in Canada or abroad.
Other than work and a career I would like to travel when I have graudated
